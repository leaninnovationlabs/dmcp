    ### ⚓ dmcp App
    - This is version 1.0.1.
    - The **dmcp App** is deployed at naval edge sites to provide low-latency access to operational data, personnel tools, and logistics systems, even with limited or intermittent connectivity.  
    Designed for resilience, it supports offline-first workflows such as digital ID, mission briefings, supply tracking, and training access.  
    The edge version runs in lightweight containers (e.g., Docker) orchestrated by Kubernetes (K3s) and stores data locally using embedded databases like SQLite, syncing to central systems when online.  
    Role-based access and encryption ensure defense-grade security on-site.  
    This deployment ensures command units stay mission-ready with full functionality, even at the tactical edge.
